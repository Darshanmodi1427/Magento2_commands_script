# Magento2_commands_script
Using Web browser GUI base run Magento 2 commands.

Some times we require to clear magento cache because of some changes not reflects, even when client chnage CMS block and page changes due to cache enable changes not reflect. <br/>

So, client who do not have knowledge about SSH even then he/she can perform magento 2 some commands using GUI base, also this script would be helpful to frontend developer who can perform ssh operation without connect with SSH.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.
